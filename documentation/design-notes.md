# Design Notes

This document outlines the design choices, limitations, and future improvements for the National In-service Training application.

## Design Choices

*   **Go-based API:** The application is built in Go, which is a good choice for a high-performance, concurrent API server.
*   **PostgreSQL Database:** The application uses a PostgreSQL database, which is a robust and reliable choice for a relational database.
*   **RESTful API:** The API is designed to be RESTful, which is a standard for building web APIs.
*   **Permission-based Access Control:** The application uses a permission-based access control system, which allows for fine-grained control over who can access what.
*   **JWT for Authentication:** The application uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, which is a standard for secure authentication.
*   **Mailer for Notifications:** The application uses a mailer to send email notifications, which is useful for user registration and other events.
*   **Rate Limiting:** The application includes rate limiting to prevent abuse.
*   **CORS:** The application includes CORS support to allow cross-origin requests.
*   **Structured Logging:** The application uses structured logging, which makes it easier to parse and analyze logs.
*   **Database Migrations:** The application uses database migrations to manage database schema changes.

## Limitations

*   **No UI:** The application is a backend API server and does not have a user interface. A separate frontend application would be needed to interact with the API.
*   **Limited Scalability:** The application is designed to run on a single server. For a large-scale application, a more distributed architecture would be needed.
*   **No Caching:** The application does not use caching, which could improve performance for frequently accessed data.
*   **No Real-time Features:** The application does not have any real-time features, such as push notifications.

## Future Improvements

*   **Add a Frontend:** A frontend application could be built to provide a user interface for the API.
*   **Implement Caching:** Caching could be implemented to improve performance.
*   **Add Real-time Features:** Real-time features, such as push notifications, could be added to improve the user experience.
*   **Improve Scalability:** The application could be redesigned to be more scalable, for example, by using a microservices architecture.
*   **Add More Tests:** More tests could be added to improve the quality of the application.
*   **Add a Search Feature:** A search feature could be added to make it easier to find information.
*   **Add a File Upload Feature:** A file upload feature could be added to allow users to upload files, such as course materials.
*   **Add a Notification System:** A notification system could be added to notify users of important events.
*   **Add a User Profile Page:** A user profile page could be added to allow users to manage their account information.
